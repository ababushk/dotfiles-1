# Dotfiles from Ryukinix
[![works badge](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikku/works-on-my-machine/v0.2.0/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nikku/works-on-my-machine)

My personal dotfiles on Linux usage history. Not much user-friendly, even for me.
Be careful.

## Installing

``` bash
bash <(curl -s -L dotfiles.lerax.me)
```
